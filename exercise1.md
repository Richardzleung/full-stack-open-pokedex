Building a linter for Javascript in Rust. The Rust  compiler already comes packaged with a number of lints along with means to make unit tests. The Rust package manager is named 'Cargo' and it builds our code into an executable called 'crates'. Cargo allows Rust packages to declare their numerous dependencies and ensures repeatable builds, such as with npm and yarn. 

Some of the options in Rust for CI include Travis CI, Github Actions and sr.ht.  

Assuming we were to build an application that does not require the use specific hardware the simpler and often desirable choice for a CI setup are cloud solutions. Having a quicker set-up means we are able to start getting up to scale that much more quickly which is imperative for delivering products as soon as possible. However, the same cannot be said if our product dwarfs the capacity of the cloud options available to us, either monetarily or flexibility. In such situations it may be better to pursue self-hosted setups as they can be cheaper and customized to our needs, with the only costs being labor and hardware. With that comes the potential downsides of having complicated set-up times and hardware issues yet based on our situation may be the only feasible choice may be a self-hosted setup.
